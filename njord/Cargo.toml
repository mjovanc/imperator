# This cfg cannot be enabled, but it still forces Cargo to keep njord_derive's
# version in lockstep with njord's, even if someone depends on the two crates
# separately with njord's "derive" feature disabled. Every njord_derive release
# is compatible with exactly one serde release because the generated code
# involves nonpublic APIs which are not bound by semver.
