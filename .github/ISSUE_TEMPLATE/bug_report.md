<!--
**Double-check**

* Is this *really* a bug?
  - If the behavior is documented, but you disagree with it, please do file an issue, but as a "Design consideration," not a "Bug report."
  - If you don't understand why something behaves the way it does, create an issue or send a DM on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mjovanc.
* Is the problem not in some third-party library, not in [imperator](https://github.com/mjovanc/njord/issues)?
* Maybe you're using some ancient version, and the problem doesn't happen with the latest releases of the compiler and the library?

**Describe the bug**

What happened? What should have happened instead?

**Provide a Reproducer**

* If possible, please provide a small self-contained project (or even just a single file) where the issue reproduces.
* If you can't pinpoint the issue, please provide at least *some* project where this reproduces, for example, your production one. If you are not ready to show the project publicly, we are open to discussing the details privately.
* If you really can't provide any code, please do still open an issue. This may prompt other people to chime in with their reproducers.
