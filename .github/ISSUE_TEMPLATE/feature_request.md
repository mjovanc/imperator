<!--
**Double-check**

* Maybe this feature is already here?
  - Did you check the latest version of the library?
  - Maybe it's in a form you didn't expect? 
* Do you actually *need* this feature? Maybe restructuring your code would neatly eliminate the problem the feature would be solving.
* Is the library in the imperator the best place for this feature? Maybe it would be better suited for some third-party library?
-->

**Use case**

Explain what *specifically* you are trying to do and why.

**The Shape of the API**

What could the desired API look like? What would some sample code using the new feature look like? If you don't have a clear idea, pseudocode or just explaining the API shape is also perfectly fine.

**Prior Art**

(Optional) Maybe you have seen something like the feature you need, but in other libraries, or there is something very similar but not quite sufficient in some of our libraries? Maybe there's already a way to do it, but it's too cumbersome and unclear?
