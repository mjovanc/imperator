## Getting Started

### Initializing a new project

The first thing we need to do is generate our project.

```sh
cargo new --bin njord_demo
```

Now, let’s add Njord to our dependencies. We’re also going to use a tool called .env to manage our environment variables for us. We’ll add it to our dependencies as well.

```toml
[dependencies]

# The core APIs, including the Table trait. 
# using #[derive(Table)] to make njord work with structs
# and enums defined in your crate.
njord = { version = "<version>", features = ["sqlite"] }
njord_derive = { version = "<version>" }
```

### Add a schema file

Now we are going to define our schema file that we will create under `src/schema.rs`. We will store basically our structs that will map against the database. 

```rust
#[derive(Table)]
#[table_name = "users"]
pub struct User {
    id: usize,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    address: String,
}

#[derive(Table)]
#[table_name = "categories"]
pub struct Category {
    id: usize,
    name: String,
}

#[derive(Table)]
#[table_name = "products"]
pub struct Product {
    id: usize,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    price: f64,
    stock_quantity: usize,
    category: Category,     // one-to-one relationship
    discount: Option<f64>,  // allow for null 
}

#[derive(Table)]
#[table_name = "orders"]
pub struct Order {
    id: usize,
    user: User,             // one-to-one relationship
    products: Vec<Product>, // one-to-many relationship - populates from based on junction table (gets from macro attribute "table_name" and combines them for example, orders_products)
    total_cost: f64,
}
```

Now that we have that in place, we need to create the SQL for setting this up in the database and execute it.

```sql
-- users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    category INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    discount: REAL NULL
);

-- orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    total_cost REAL NOT NULL
);

-- order_products table
CREATE TABLE order_products (
    order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id),
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```

## Usage

So how can we establish a connection and actually select or insert data to our database? Let's go through it. Note that these examples might be outdated, so dont treat it as a source of truth.

### SQlite 

#### Establish a connection

To establish a connection we first need to call the `sqlite::open()` function and use it with a match statement.

```rust
let db_name = "njord.db";
let db_path = Path::new(&db_name);

match sqlite::open(db_path) {
    Ok(c) => {
        println!("Database opened successfully!");
        
        // Additional logic when we are connected.
        // We need to open a connection and pass it 
        // to the corresponding sqlite function.
    }
    Err(err) => eprintln!("Error opening the database: {}", err),
}
```

#### Insert data

```rust
let user = User {
    username: String::from("john_doe"),
    email: String::from("john@example.com"),
    address: String::from("123 Main St"),
};

let result = sqlite::insert(c, vec![user]);
assert!(result.is_ok());
```

**Generated SQL**

```sql
INSERT INTO 
    users (username, email, address) 
VALUES 
    ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', '123 Main St')
```

#### Update data

```rust
let columns = vec!["username".to_string(), "address".to_string()];
let where_condition = Condition::Eq("username".to_string(), "john_doe".to_string());

let user = User {
    username: String::from("john_doe_2"),
    email: String::from("john@example.com"),
    address: String::from("1234 Main St"),
};

let mut order = HashMap::new();
order.insert(vec!["id".to_string()], "DESC".to_string());
        
let result = sqlite::update(c, user)
    .set(columns)
    .where_clause(where_condition)
    .order_by(order)
    .limit(4)
    .offset(0)
    .build();

assert!(result.is_ok());
```

**Generated SQL**

```sql
UPDATE 
    users 
SET WHERE 
    username = 'john_doe' 
ORDER BY 
    id DESC 
LIMIT 4 
OFFSET 0
```

#### Delete data

```rust
let where_condition = Condition::Eq("username".to_string(), "john_doe".to_string());

let mut order = HashMap::new();
order.insert(vec!["id".to_string()], "DESC".to_string());

let result = sqlite::delete(c)
    .from(User::default())
    .where_clause(where_condition)
    .order_by(order)
    .limit(20)
    .offset(0)
    .build();

assert!(result.is_ok());
```

**Generated SQL**

```sql
DELETE FROM 
    users 
WHERE 
    username = 'john_doe' 
ORDER BY 
    id DESC 
LIMIT 20 
OFFSET 0
```

#### Select data

```rust
let columns = vec!["id".to_string(), "username".to_string(), "email".to_string(), "address".to_string()];
let where_condition = Condition::Eq("username".to_string(), "john_doe".to_string());
let group_by = vec!["username".to_string(), "address".to_string()];

let mut order_by = HashMap::new();
order_by.insert(vec!["id".to_string()], "ASC".to_string());

let having_condition = Condition::Gt("id".to_string(), "1".to_string());

// Build the query
// We need to pass the struct User with the Default trait in .from()
let result: Result<Vec<User>> = sqlite::select(c, columns)
    .from(User::default())
    .where_clause(where_condition)
    .order_by(order_by)
    .group_by(group_by)
    .having(having_condition)
    .build();

match result {
    Ok(result) => {
        assert_eq!(result.len(), 1);
    }
    Err(error) => panic!("Failed to SELECT: {:?}", error),
};
```

**Generated SQL**

```sql
SELECT 
    id, username, email, address 
FROM 
    users 
WHERE 
    username = 'mjovanc' 
GROUP BY 
    username, email 
HAVING 
    id > 1 
ORDER BY 
    email
DESC 
```
